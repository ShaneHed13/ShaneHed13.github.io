    <h1>Shane Hedrington</h1>
    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
        I am available to meet during the week at 8pm and afterwards.
        On weekends, I also always availabe after 8pm, but depending on my
        wife's work schedule, will likely have availability during the day time
        on both Saturday and Sunday'
    </p>

    <h3>Pitch 1</h3>
    <p>a Goal Tracking Web Application for school districts who need to monitor, score, and display
    inforomation regarding students with IEP's or with unique needs.'</p>

    <h3>Pitch 2</h3>
    <p>A satire news website that is database driven, and adding articles to the site is part
    of the websites functionality.  I have this one worked on some on my own free time, bare bones,
    but not awful given how much less I knew back when I was messing with it</p>

    <h3>Pitch 3</h3>
    <p>A website or web app that will scrore a variety of mental health assessments digitally, and provide results print outs.
    Many commonly used mental health assessments are still scored by hand.  being able to do this digitally,
    produce an algorithm to score them correctly and nice print out sheets.  Bing bang boom.</p>
